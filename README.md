# Introduction

You used to work as a freelance software developer, but now you've applied for a job as a developer at a large software development company. The company's management wants to test your skills, so as part of the recruitment process, they asked you to develop prototype applications for the GreenWind company.

In the prototype, all you need to develop is an import script, a map view and a small simulation service. The simulation service helps wind turbine planners plan the proper layout of wind turbines in an area.

- Your API must use a [JSON Server stable version (v0.17.4)](https://github.com/typicode/json-server/tree/v0) as its data provider.
- Your UI has to use the provided images/icons for visualization.
- Finally you have to create a short demo video to show your presentation skills.

# Description of project and tasks

Your task is divided into four parts.

1. In the first part, you will develop a script to import maps.
2. In the second part, you will develop a map view.
3. In the third part, you will extend the map view with a basic simulation service.
4. In the fourth part, you have to create a demo video.

# How to submit your work

1. To submit your work, you will need to share a GitHub repository (hereafter referred to as repo) containing the source code of your solution. We prefer that executable files or built solution are included in your repo too.

You then need to share the repo containing your solution with us. To do this, use our GitHub id `skillsithu`.
2. Just in case, send the link of your repo to es2027s09@skillsit.hu.
4. Your README file has to contain the instructions how to start your project backend and frontend.
